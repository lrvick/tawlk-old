WHAT IS KRAL?
	A social media crawling engine, built on Django. 
    Aims to provide a framework for rapidly collect data from social networks
    based on defined search criteria. Built to be a foundation for a wide 
    range of social applications, and to bring accountability  and public 
    to the way in which data is collected and promote others to get involved
    to help us collect as much data as possible with the fewest resources.

CURRENT FEATURES:

 * Ability to harvest user information, and posts from Twitter and 

 * Ability to expand all short-urls into full real URLs.

 * Modular design. Easily add or disable "kraling" for different social networks.

NOTES

  Many more features coming soon as this project is under active development.

	This is by no means production-ready code. Do not actually use it in
	production unless you wish to be eaten by a grue.
