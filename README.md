# Kralit #

A sample social media search engine, using Kral at its core.

See documentation in the kral folder to learn how to use it.


## Starting Kralit ##

We've been investigating several types of Comet setup to run this efficiently. We'll document using Kralit when we've settled on something.


## Notes ##

This is by no means production-ready code. Do not actually use it in
production unless you wish to be eaten by a grue.
